     *  Output :  A flow f from s to t which is a maximum
     *      f(u,v) <- 0 for all edges (u,v)
     *      While there is a path p from s to t in Gf, such that cf(u,v) > 0 for all edges (u,v) belong to p:
     *          Find cf(p) = min{cf(u,v) : (u,v) belong to p}
     *          For each edge (u,v) belong to p
